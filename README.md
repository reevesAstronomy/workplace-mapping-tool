# workplace-mapping-tool
Developed (with ChatGPT as a coding copilot) to function as a web-based workplace mapping tool to enable labour union drives to map where workers are and keep track if follow-up is needed, etc. Has other potential uses listed below. Designed to be simple for organizers doing outreach on the go but also keep personal info anonymous (ie: how many are in each room and is follow-up needed, but not who is supportive/etc). Can of course add notes for each room.

Example use cases:
- Door-knocking to get union cards signed as part of a union drive (maybe also prep for a strike vote?).
- Door-knocking as part of an effort to form a tenant union
- Door-knocking to help organize a neighbourhood/community around petitions or municipal grant proposals (like LoveMyHood community project grants in Kitchener, Ontario)
