# workplace-mapping-tool
A workplace mapping tool to enable labour union drives to map where workers are and keep track if follow-up is needed, etc.

Particular use cases: door-knocking to get union cards signed as part of a union drive (maybe also prep for a strike vote?). Designed to be simple and keep personal info anonymous.
